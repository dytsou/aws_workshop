An operating system is software that manages a computer's hardware. It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware. An amazing aspect of operating systems is how they vary in accomplishing these tasks in a wide variety of computing environments. Operating systems are everywhere, from cars and home appliances that include "Internet of Things" devices, to smart phones, personal computers, enterprise computers, and cloud computing envi- ronments. 作業系統是管理計算機硬件的軟件。它還為應用程序提供了基礎，並作為計算機用戶和計算機硬件之間的中介。作業系統的一個令人驚嘆的方面是它們在各種運算環境中完成這些任務方面的各種不同。從包括「物聯網」裝置的汽車和家用電器，到智能手機、個人電腦、企業電腦以及雲端運算環境，無處不在。
